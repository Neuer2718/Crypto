# Cracking Codes with Python

Welcome! This project contains my code and notes as I work through the book **Cracking Codes with Python** by Al Sweigart. It‚Äôs a fun and practical way to learn Python and cryptography.

## üíª How to Run the Code

1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.  
2. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Neuer2718/cracking-codes-python.git
    cd cracking-codes-python
    ```

3. Run the examples, for example:

    ```bash
    python chapter1/caesar_cipher.py
    ```

4. Modify the code to experiment and deepen your understanding.

## üìå Notes & Learnings

I‚Äôm keeping a `NOTES.md` file with what I learn in each chapter.  
Here‚Äôs a sample note:

> **Chapter 1:**  
> - Learned about the Caesar cipher and how to shift letters.  
> - Practice with basic string manipulation in Python.
